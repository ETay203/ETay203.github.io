<h2><strong>DATA SCIENTIST | DATA ANALYIST | PROJECT MANAGER</strong></h2>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Works in R and Python, with skills in statistical analysis, predictive modelling and data wrangling</strong></em></p>
                                
<p>Data analyst professional who enjoys exploring and visualising data, finding patterns and quantifying insights. Highly numerate with great math and statistical skills. Experienced in communicating complex technical information to a non-technical audience. Continuously loves developing and expanding skills and experience.</p>

<br></br>
<h2><strong>TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS AND PROGRAMMING SKILLS</strong></h2>
<hr>

<p><strong>Markup/Programming:</strong> : Python (Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, json, scikit-learn), R (ggplot2, dplyr, knitr), R-Markdown, SQL, MySQL, XPath, XQuery and XSLT, Perl, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), LaTeX, HTML, CSS</p>
<p><strong>Applications:</strong> Microsoft Office, Google Drive, Git, RStudio, BigQuery</p>
<p><strong>OS/Environments:</strong> Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac</p>

<br></br>
<h2><strong>PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE AND CERTIFICATIONS</strong></h2>
<hr>
<p><strong>Lead Researcher, SourcingBot, Berlin, Germany May 2019 &ndash; May 2020</strong></p>
<p>Sourcingbot.com is an online platform that optimises the sourcing and purchasing of electronic components for manufacturing.  It provides a parametric search of around 6.6 million parts combining lab measured data with manufacturer datasheets.  A matching algorithm determines similar parts as replacements.</p>
<li>Took ownership of entire data normalization pipeline  - cleaned and restructured data of over 5 million parts</li>
<li>Adapted and contributed to a mature repository of python code using git and CircleCI.</li>
<li>Designed and implemented quality control processes of data from raw input to front-end.</li>
<li>Coded and implemented batch processing of capacitor calculations and their graphical results.</li>
<li>Wrote and ran SQL queries to match and verify 1000s of equivalent parts in the sourcingbot database on  BigQuery.  Became the go-to person for extracting data from BigQuery.</li>
<p><strong>Self-Employed/Self-Educated/Freelance Consultant 2017 &ndash; May 2020</strong></p>
<p><u>John Hopkins University Data Science Certification<u/> composed of ten courses including: R Programming, Getting and Cleaning Data, Exploratory Data Analysis, Reproducible Research, Statistical Inference, Regression Modelling and Machine Learning.  Project submissions can be viewed on etay203.github.io/projects. A few favourites were:</p>
<li>Used a weight lifting exercise dataset to build three different models (a simple classification tree, a boosted predictor using the boosted trees method and a random forest predictor) in order to predict how well participants did the exercise.</li>
<li>A two-part statistics project. First, a simulation of the exponential distribution in R to demonstrate the central limit theorem. Second explored the effect of Vitamin C supplements on tooth growth using the ToothGrowth data in R datasets package.</li>
<li>Applied knowledge of regression to answer “Are Manual or Automatic transmission cars more fuel efficient?”. Explored the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon, with least squares and inference using regression of linear and multivariable models.</li>
<p><strong>Consultant and Associate Consultant, Galson Sciences Ltd. (GSL), Oakham, UK 2009 &ndash;2016</strong></p>
<p>GSL provides a range of nuclear decommissioning and radioactive waste management services. Independently managed and supported a range of projects for both domestic and international clients. Developed models, and coded programmes to support environmental impact assessments, for example:</p>
<li>Coded, tested and implemented a bespoke computational tool – enabled the client to quantify and specify radioactive doses.</li>
<li>Developed and coded a statistical analysis tool - optimized strategies for monitoring and inspection by waste store operators.  The tool enabled different sites to plan and tailor their most efficient schedule for monitoring and inspecting waste canisters.</li>
<li>Designed and built a large relational database from scratch - established data integrity ensuring government compliance by tracking lists of design features, events and processes.  Made the process reproducible and saved the client time.</li>
<li>Presented complex data to non-technical audience as easy-to-interpret graphics and reports. Demonstrated compliance with nuclear safety regulations.</li>
<p><strong>Graduate Student, Imperial College, London, UK 2000 &ndash;2009</strong></p>
<li>Utilized numerous statistical techniques, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo for predicting material structures.</li>
<li>Optimized high volumes of simulations by running batch calculations across different processors in parallel, maximising speed and efficiency.</li>
<li>Published work in peer reviewed papers</li>
<li>Presented work publically at several international conferences.</li>
