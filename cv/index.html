<h2><strong>PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE AND CERTIFICATIONS</strong></h2>
<hr>
<p><strong>Lead Researcher, <a href="https://sourcingbot.com/">Sourcingbot.com </a> , Berlin, Germany, &emsp; May 2019 &ndash; May 2020</strong></p>
<li>Took ownership of entire data normalization pipeline –  cleaned and restructured data of over 5 million parts.</li>
<li>Conducted statistical analyses of predicted electrical parameters.</li>
<li>Wrote and ran complex SQL queries to match and verify 1000s of equivalent parts in the sourcingbot database on  BigQuery.  Became the go-to person for extracting data from BigQuery.</li>
<li>Coded and implemented batch processing of capacitor calculations and their graphical results in Python.</li>
<li>Wrote and added functions, contributing to a mature repository of Python code.</li>
<li>Ran unit tests to test and verify changes to data.</li>
<li>Used github and CircleCI, interacting daily between the front and back-end developers.</li>
<li>Introduced quality control processes to data handling from raw input to front-end.</li>
<li>Independently communicated research team progress to investor.</li>
<p><strong>Maternity Leave and Continued Skill Development, India and Germany, May 2016 &ndash; May 2019</strong></p>
<p>A career break due to maternity leave, focused on maintaining and enhancing my skill set.  Relocated to Berlin, Germany from Bangalore, India.</p>
<p><u>John Hopkins University Data Science Certification</u> composed of ten courses including: R Programming, Getting and Cleaning Data, Exploratory Data Analysis, Reproducible Research, Statistical Inference, Regression Modelling and Machine Learning.  Project submissions can be viewed on etay203.github.io/projects. A few favourites were:</p>
<li>Used a weight lifting exercise dataset to build three different models (a simple classification tree, a boosted predictor using the boosted trees method and a random forest predictor) in order to predict how well participants did the exercise.</li>
<li>A two-part statistics project. First, a simulation of the exponential distribution in R to demonstrate the central limit theorem. Second explored the effect of Vitamin C supplements on tooth growth using the ToothGrowth data in R datasets package.</li>
<li>Applied knowledge of regression to answer “Are Manual or Automatic transmission cars more fuel efficient?”. Explored the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon, with least squares and inference using regression of linear and multivariable models.</li>
<p> Undertook German language lessons level upto A2.2</p>
<p><strong>Associate Scientific Consultant, <a href="https://www.galson-sciences.co.uk/">Galson Sciences Ltd. (GSL)</a>, USA and India, June 2012 &ndash; May 2016</strong></p>
<p>Independently managed and supported a range of nuclear decommissioning and radioactive waste management projects for both UK domestic and international clients.  
Developed prediction models, coded programs and wrote reports to support environmental impact and risk assessments. 
Worked remotely on projects for GSL whilst relocating internationally.  Lived in San Francisco USA before moving to Bangalore India. Further examples of my contributions given below.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific Consultant, Galson Sciences Ltd. (GSL), Oakham, UK September 2009 &ndash; June 2012</strong></p>
<li>Excellent knowledge of MS Excel and VBA/Macro having coded, tested and implemented a bespoke computational tool – enabled the client to quantify and predict radioactive doses for environmental assessments.</li>
<li>Developed and coded a statistical analysis tool - optimized strategies for monitoring and inspection by waste store operators.  The tool enabled different sites to plan and tailor their most efficient schedule for monitoring and inspecting waste canisters.</li>
<li>Documented data analysis tools with data dictionaries and user manuals as well as, demonstrating and presenting to clients.</li>
<li>Designed and built a large relational database from scratch - established data integrity ensuring government compliance by tracking lists of design features, events and processes.  Made the process reproducible and saved the client time.</li>
<li>Assessed values for landfill sites accepting solid-low level radioactive wastes.  Surveyed types of waste, reported the range and quality of the corresponding data available, proposed best estimates and discussed revision of parameters with the Environment Agency.</li>
<li>Presented complex data to non-technical audience as easy-to-interpret graphics and reports. Demonstrated compliance with nuclear safety regulations.</li>
<p><strong>Graduate Student, Imperial College, London, UK 2005 &ndash;2009</strong></p>
<li>Utilized numerous statistical techniques, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo for predicting material structures.</li>
<li>Optimized high volumes of simulations by running batch calculations across different processors in parallel, maximising speed and efficiency.</li>
<li>Published work in peer reviewed papers</li>
<li>Presented work publically at several international conferences.</li>
