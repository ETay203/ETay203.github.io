	<h1>Projects and Assignments</h1>
	<p>Starting in mid 2016 I undertook the <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science">John Hopkins University Data Science Certification</a> composed of ten courses. Courses are assessed through peer-reviewed assignments.
	Here are some of the assignments and projects I've done.  Click the bolded list items to link to the actual project submissions and reports: </p>
	<li><strong><a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ETay203/Prediction-Assignment/blob/master/Prediction_Assignment_report1.html">Prediction Models:</a></strong> The project used a weight lifting excercise dataset to build three different models (a simple classification tree, a boosted predictor using the boosted trees method and a random forest predictor) in order to predict the manner (how well) in which they did the exercise. </li>
	<li><strong>Statistical Inference:</strong> This project is reported in two parts. <strong><a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ETay203/Statistical-Inference-Project/blob/master/Part1.html">Part 1 </a></strong>is a simulation excercise to investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. 
		<strong><a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ETay203/Statistical-Inference-Project/blob/master/Part2.html">Part 2 </a></strong> demonstrates basic inferential data analysis by exploring the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ETay203/Manual-vs-Automatic">Regression Models</a>:</strong> This project applied regression to answer “Is Manual or Automatic transmission more fuel efficient?”. My report explored the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon, with least squares and inference using regression of linear and multivariable models.  </li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://rpubs.com/ETay203/226655">Reproducible research</a>:</strong>  This project involved analysis of the <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/">NOAA storm event database</a>.  It required processing a large and messy dataset to determine the most harmful extreme weather events with respect to population health and economics across the United States.  I used the knitr package in R to publish my analysis with my code embedded in the document.  </li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ETay203/ExData_Plotting1">Exploratory Data Plots</a>:</strong> Explored the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" taken from the <a href = "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php">UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a> . Required loading, converting and subsetting the data by date and time before generating the desired plots.</li>
        	<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ETay203/GettingData_Project"> Getting and Cleaning Data</a>:</strong> This project demonstrates my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The dataset recorded six human activities by accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ETay203/Programming-Assignment-1">Missing Values</a>:</strong> This assignment tested my ability to write functions that interact with different files of data and to deal with data containing missing values. I was required to write three different functions extracting and processing data from different files contained in a given directory. The first function 'pollutantmean.R' calculates means. The second function 'complete.R' determines the number of complete cases, i.e. where the data in each file is complete and has no missing values. The third function 'corr.R' calculates a correlation between different data based on a threshold value of complete cases.</li>

	<li><strong><a href= "https://github.com/ETay203/ProgrammingAssignment2">Cashing a matrix </a>:</strong>A simple R function to help save time -  as well as learning to fork, commit and push changes to github</li>
