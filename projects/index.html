	<h1>Projects and Assignments</h1>
	<p>I am currently undertaking the <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science">John Hopkins University Data Science Certification</a> composed of ten courses. Courses are assessed through peer-reviewed assignments.
	Here are some of the assignments and projects I've done.  Follow the links for more details: </p>
	
	<li><strong><a href= "https://github.com/ETay203/ProgrammingAssignment2">Cashing a matrix </a>:</strong>A simple R function to help save time -  as well as learning to fork, commit and push changes to github</li>
	<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ETay203/GettingData_Project"> Getting and Cleaning Data</a>:</strong> This project demonstrates my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The dataset recorded six human activities by accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="http://rpubs.com/ETay203/226655">Reproducible research</a>:</strong>  This project involved analysis of the <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/">NOAA storm event database</a>.  It required processing a large and messy dataset to determine the most harmful extreme weather events with respect to population health and economics across the United States.  I used the knitr package in R to publish my analysis with my code embedded in the document.  </li>
	<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ETay203/Programming-Assignment-1">Missing Values</a>:</strong> This assignment tested my ability to write functions that interact with different files of data and to deal with data containing missing values. I was required to write three different functions extracting and processing data from different files contained in a given directory. The first function 'pollutantmean.R' calculates means. The second function 'complete.R' determines the number of complete cases, i.e. where the data in each file is complete and has no missing values. The third function 'corr.R' calculates a correlation between different data based on a threshold value of complete cases.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ETay203/Statistical-Inference-Project">Statistical Inference</a>:</strong> This project is reported in two parts. Part 1 is a simulation excercise to investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. Part 2 demonstrates basic inferential data analysis by exploring the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.</li>
	
	<li><strong><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022459608004805?via%3Dihub">Predicting structures</a>:</strong> Atomic scale local density functional simulations and configurational averaging are used to predict the energies and lattice parameters associated with mixed calcium/strontium fluorapatites.  This was a first authorship paper published during my PhD in the Journal for Solid State Chemistry under my maiden name Michie. </li>
