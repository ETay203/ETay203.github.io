	<h1>Projects and Assignments</h1>
	<p>I am currently undertaking the <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science">John Hopkins University Data Science Certification</a> composed of ten courses. Courses are assessed through peer-reviewed assignments.
	Here are some of the assignments and projects I've done.  Follow the links for more details: </p>
	
	<li><strong><a href= "https://github.com/ETay203/ProgrammingAssignment2">Cashing a matrix </a>:</strong>A simple R function to help save time -  as well as learning to fork, commit and push changes to github</li>
	<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ETay203/GettingData_Project"> Getting and Cleaning Data</a>:</strong> This project demonstrates my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The dataset used recorded six human activities by accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="http://rpubs.com/ETay203/226655">Reproducible research</a>:</strong>  This project involved processing a large and messy dataset from NOAA to determine the most harmful extreme weather events with respect to population health and economics across the United States.  I used the knitr package in R to publish my analysis with my code embedded in the document.  </li>
