So, no sooner than I have started my site, I'm tracking traffic using [Google Anayltics](https://analytics.google.com). To do this I registered my github page with Google Anaytics to generate a unique tracking ID.  They then generate a snippet that I have included in the head of my default page layout.  This means that snippet is included in the head of all the pages associated with this site and will track any visitors accordingly.   Let's hope I get some :)
